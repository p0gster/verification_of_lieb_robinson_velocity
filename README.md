# verification_of_lieb_robinson_velocity
Simulates a system of quantum particles in a magnetic field and draws a graph of the component of each spin in the z direction over time.
We can see a cone, which demonstrates that there is a speed that bounds the rate of exchange of information, this is the lieb robinson velocity.
